A very simple PHP library for posting to several social networks, started out
of frustration for not finding anything like it besides Hybridauth, which
doesn't really suite my needs or quality requirements.

For now it only supports Facebook and Twitter. More networks will come soon.

Built in a hurry (no tests, few comments) because its meant for a product
that has been delayed due to non-stop issues with Hybridauth. I will eventually
improve this.
