HERE BE DRAGONS!

This is being updated in a hurry and the code is ugly, so don't expect to be
able to use this easily for your own project, because for now it's not meant to
be used in anything other than the project I'm working on.

This is a very simple PHP library for posting to several social networks, started out
of frustration for not finding anything like it besides Hybridauth, which
doesn't really suite my needs or quality requirements.

For now it only supports Facebook and Twitter. More networks will come soon.

Built in a hurry (no tests, few comments) because its meant for a product
that has been delayed due to non-stop issues with Hybridauth. I will eventually
improve this.
